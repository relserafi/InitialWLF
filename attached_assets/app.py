Thank you for using City Life Pharmacy, I have reviewed your medical intake and I have put
together the following treatment plan for you below. Please read it carefully.
You have been prescribed compounded semaglutide oral dissolving film. 

Oraldissolving films are a novel way to take semaglutide that allows you to receive the
dose effectively and safely. Oral dissolving films allow you to bypass the digestive
tract which allows you to get more of the medication into your bloodstream without
being broken down by your stomach acids or liver. This also would reduce the side
effects of the medication.

Taking GLP-1 medication like semaglutide while taking steps toward maintaining a
healthy diet and lifestyle can help you achieve your target weight.
Please note: Your prescription has been sent to the pharmacy for processing and
fulfillment and should ship out within 3-4 business days.

Imagine your GLP-1 medication is like a gas pedal for your hunger. At first, you
might need to press down a bit more (higher dose) to feel satisfied with less food and
reach your weight loss goals. This helps you ease off the gas and eat less.

The good news is, as you keep using the medication, your body gets used to this
setting (reaches steady-state). Once you've reached your goal weight or your
cravings are under control at a specific dose, you don't need to keep pushing down
on the gas pedal further (increasing the dose). You can keep your foot at that
comfortable level (steady-state dose) to maintain your progress!

This means you can take your GLP-1 medication consistently at the same dose to
keep your appetite in check and your weight loss on track. Talk to your doctor about
when a steady-state dose might be the right "cruising speed" for you.

*On your next refill order date, you will be asked a series of questions with your refill
order, which will help me determine if you need to be increased, or kept at the same
dose*

<strong>*Please make sure to follow up with your primary care physician for routine
screening including evaluation of your cholesterol levels, thyroid levels, and other
routine lab testing*</strong>

<strong>How should you take semaglutide strips?</strong>
Make sure your hands are dry and clean before removing the strips. The strip should
then be removed from its packaging and placed either under the tongue (sublingual)
or between your gum and cheek (buccal). The strip should start dissolving almost
immediately when it comes in contact with your saliva. Allow it to rest in place for 90
seconds before swallowing any remaining undissolved portion of the strip. You may
drink water after this step although it is not necessary. The starting dose of the strips
is to take it 3 times a week. We recommend taking it every other day such as
Monday/Wednesday/Friday. The dose may be increased to daily based on your
response.

<strong>What is the titration schedule with semaglutide strips?</strong>
In general, the starting dose is 1 mg taken three times a week for the first month.
This allows your body to get used to the medication and observe if you experience
any side effects. The dose can be increased to 2 mg three times a week if you
tolerate the medication. If more response is required and if you are tolerating the
medication well, the medication can be increased to 2 mg once daily.


<strong>How should semaglutide strips be stored?</strong>
The medication should be stored at room temperature and in an area away from light
and moisture. We recommend storing it in your bedroom or living room area as those
areas are generally not exposed to fluctuations in temperature and aren‚Äôt exposed to
moisture.

<strong>WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE SEMAGLUTIDE?</strong>
Patients to whom the following apply are not eligible for Semaglutide Treatment:
- Eating Disorder
- Gallbladder Disease (does not include gallbladder removal/cholecystectomy)
- Drug Abuse
- Alcohol Abuse
- Recent Bariatric Surgery
- Pancreatitis
- Personal or family history of medullary Thyroid Cancer
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome (MEN-2)
- Currently Pregnant
- Currently Breastfeeding
- Planning to Become Pregnant
- Retinopathy


<strong>WHAT ARE THE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF SEMAGLUTIDE?</strong>
- Nausea is most common in customers beginning treatment with Semaglutide.
Other common side effects are abdominal pain, headaches, fatigue, constipation,
diarrhea, dizziness, upset stomach, and heartburn. Please let us know if you are
experiencing any adverse symptoms and call 911 or go to the emergency room if
you feel like you are experiencing a medical emergency.

Thank you and please contact us if you have any questions or concerns

you feel like you are experiencing a medical emergency.

<strong>How do you take sublingual semaglutide drops?</strong>
Draw up 1 ml using the syringe given to you and place the drops underneath the
tongue once daily. Press down your tongue for at least 90 seconds to keep the liquid
in place to allow for proper absorption of the medication. Do not eat or drink anything
for at least half an hour after using the medication. The preferred time to use the
medication is in the evening towards bed time.

<strong>What is the titration schedule of Semaglutide drops?</strong>
The general starting point for semaglutide sublingual drops is 0.5 mg once daily for 1
month. This first month is to get your body used to the medication and to see if any
side effects are observed. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to 1 mg daily
for a month and then possibly 2 mg and 3 mg in the third and fourth month based on
response and tolerability. Month 2-3 is when usually most people start to see
meaningful changes in their weight.

<strong>How should Semaglitude drops be stored?</strong>
The medication should be stored at room temperature and in an area away from light
and moisture. We recommend storing it in your bedroom or living room area as those
areas are generally not exposed to fluctuations in temperature and aren‚Äôt exposed to
moisture.
