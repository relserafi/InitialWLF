Thank you for using City Life Pharmacy, I have reviewed your medical intake and I have put together the following treatment plan for you below. Please read it carefully.

You have been prescribed compounded semaglutide oral dissolving film. 

Oraldissolving films are a novel way to take semaglutide that allows you to receive the dose effectively and safely. Oral dissolving films allow you to bypass the digestive tract which allows you to get more of the medication into your bloodstream without being broken down by your stomach acids or liver. This also would reduce the side effects of the medication.

Taking GLP-1 medication like semaglutide while taking steps toward maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle can help you achieve your target weight.

Please note: Your prescription has been sent to the pharmacy for processing and fulfillment and should ship out within 3-4 business days.

Imagine your GLP-1 medication is like a gas pedal for your hunger. At first, you might need to press down a bit more (higher dose) to feel satisfied with less food and reach your weight loss goals. This helps you ease off the gas and eat less.

The good news is, as you keep using the medication, your body gets used to this setting (reaches steady-state). Once you've reached your goal weight or your cravings are under control at a specific dose, you don't need to keep pushing down on the gas pedal further (increasing the dose). You can keep your foot at that comfortable level (steady-state dose) to maintain your progress!

This means you can take your GLP-1 medication consistently at the same dose to keep your appetite in check and your weight loss on track. Talk to your doctor about when a steady-state dose might be the right "cruising speed" for you.

*On your next refill order date, you will be asked a series of questions with your refill order, which will help me determine if you need to be increased, or kept at the same dose*

<strong>*Please make sure to follow up with your primary care physician for routine screening including evaluation of your cholesterol levels, thyroid levels, and other routine lab testing*</strong>

<strong>How should you take semaglutide strips?</strong>
Make sure your hands are dry and clean before removing the strips. The strip should then be removed from its packaging and placed either under the tongue (sublingual) or between your gum and cheek (buccal). The strip should start dissolving almost immediately when it comes in contact with your saliva. Allow it to rest in place for 90 seconds before swallowing any remaining undissolved portion of the strip. You may drink water after this step although it is not necessary. The starting dose of the strips is 0.5 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to daily based on your response.

<strong>What is the titration schedule with semaglutide strips?</strong>
In general, the starting dose is 0.5 mg taken once daily for one month. This allows your body to get used to the medication and observe if you experienceany side effects. The dose can be increased to 1 mg once daily for another month if you are tolerating the medication well. The dose can be increased to 2 and 3 mg once daily for the third and foruth month based on your response and if you are tolerating the medication well. 

<strong>How should semaglutide strips be stored?</strong>
The medication should be stored at room temperature and in an area away from light and moisture. We recommend storing it in your bedroom or living room area as those areas are generally not exposed to fluctuations in temperature and aren't exposed to moisture.

<strong>WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE SEMAGLUTIDE?</strong>
Patients to whom the following apply are not eligible for Semaglutide Treatment:
- Eating Disorder
- Gallbladder Disease (does not include gallbladder removal/cholecystectomy)
- Drug Abuse
- Alcohol Abuse
- Recent Bariatric Surgery
- Pancreatitis
- Personal or family history of medullary Thyroid Cancer
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome (MEN-2)
- Currently Pregnant
- Currently Breastfeeding
- Planning to Become Pregnant
- Retinopathy


<strong>WHAT ARE THE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF SEMAGLUTIDE?</strong>
- Nausea is most common in customers beginning treatment with Semaglutide. Other common side effects are abdominal pain, headaches, fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, upset stomach, and heartburn. Please let us know if you are experiencing any adverse symptoms and call 911 or go to the emergency room if you feel like you are experiencing a medical emergency.

<strong>How do you take sublingual semaglutide drops?</strong>
Draw up 1 ml using the syringe given to you and place the drops underneath the tongue once daily. Press down your tongue for at least 90 seconds to keep the liquid in place to allow for proper absorption of the medication. Do not eat or drink anything for at least half an hour after using the medication. The preferred time to use the medication is in the evening towards bed time.

<strong>What is the titration schedule of Semaglutide drops?</strong>
The general starting point for semaglutide sublingual drops is 0.5 mg once daily for 1 month. This first month is to get your body used to the medication and to see if any side effects are observed. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to 1 mg daily for a month and then possibly 2 mg and 3 mg in the third and fourth month based on response and tolerability. Month 2-3 is when usually most people start to see meaningful changes in their weight.

<strong>How should Semaglitude drops be stored?</strong>
The medication should be stored at room temperature and in an area away from light and moisture. We recommend storing it in your bedroom or living room area as those areas are generally not exposed to fluctuations in temperature and aren't exposed to moisture.

together the following treatment plan for you below. Please read it carefully.
You have been prescribed Ozempic (semaglutide). This medication typically follows
a titration schedule that is outlined below. At your follow up your physician will
determine if you are to increase, decrease, or stay at your current dose.
We have attached detailed instructions on how to inject Ozempic to this email.

<strong>Please read it carefully.</strong>

<strong>Ozempic Dosing Schedule:</strong>
Month 1: Inject 0.25mg subcutaneously once weekly x 4 weeks.
Month 2: Inject 0.5mg subcutaneously once weekly x 4 weeks.
Month 3: Inject 1 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks
*Follow up visit*
Month 4: Inject 1mg subcutaneously once weekly x 4 weeks
Wegovy Dosing Schedule:
Month 5: Inject 1.75mg subcutaneously once weekly x 4 weeks
Month 6: Inject 2mg subcutaneously once weekly x 4 weeks
*Months 5 and 6 are dispensed as Wegovy to ensure the most cost effective
semaglutide option.

Taking GLP-1 medication like semaglutide while taking steps toward maintaining a
healthy diet and lifestyle can help you achieve your target weight.

<strong>Please note: Your prescription has been sent to the pharmacy for processing and
fulfillment and should ship out within 1-2 business days. </strong>

Please <strong>store</strong> Ozempic and Wegovy pens in the fridge until you are ready to use the medication. Once the
medication is out of the fridge, it can be stored at room temperature for 56 days.
Imagine your GLP-1 medication is like a gas pedal for your hunger. At first, you
might need to press down a bit more (higher dose) to feel satisfied with less food and
reach your weight loss goals. This helps you ease off the gas and eat less.
The good news is, as you keep using the medication, your body gets used to this
setting (reaches steady-state). Once you've reached your goal weight or your
cravings are under control at a specific dose, you don't need to keep pushing down
on the gas pedal further (increasing the dose). You can keep your foot at that
comfortable level (steady-state dose) to maintain your progress!

This means you can take your GLP-1 medication consistently at the same dose to
keep your appetite in check and your weight loss on track. Talk to your doctor about
when a steady-state dose might be the right "cruising speed" for you.

<strong>*On your next refill order date, you will be asked a series of questions with your refill
order, which will help me determine if you need to be increased, or kept at the same
dose* </strong>

<strong>*Please make sure to follow up with your primary care physician for routine
screening including evaluation of your cholesterol levels, thyroid levels, and other
routine lab testing.* </strong>

you feel like you are experiencing a medical emergency.

<strong>How do you take sublingual semaglutide drops?</strong>
Draw up 1 ml using the syringe given to you and place the drops underneath the
tongue once daily. Press down your tongue for at least 90 seconds to keep the liquid
in place to allow for proper absorption of the medication. Do not eat or drink anything
for at least half an hour after using the medication. The preferred time to use the
medication is in the evening towards bed time.

<strong>What is the titration schedule of Semaglutide drops?</strong>
The general starting point for semaglutide sublingual drops is 0.5 mg once daily for 1
month. This first month is to get your body used to the medication and to see if any
side effects are observed. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to 1 mg daily
for a month and then possibly 2 mg and 3 mg in the third and fourth month based on
response and tolerability. Month 2-3 is when usually most people start to see
meaningful changes in their weight.

<strong>How should Semaglitude drops be stored?</strong>
The medication should be stored at room temperature and in an area away from light
and moisture. We recommend storing it in your bedroom or living room area as those
areas are generally not exposed to fluctuations in temperature and aren't exposed to
moisture.

Thank you and please reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns!
